Outline:

PART 1:

1.  What problems does workflow management solve?
2.  Quick demo of `targets`
3.  How to setup a project to use `targets` with `use_targets()`
    1.  Anatomy of `targets` project

    2.  Writing your first targets

    3.  Visualize with `tar_visnetwork()`

    4.  Make changes and re-run `tar_make()`
4.  How to refactor an existing project to use `targets`
    1.  converting code to functions using RStudio "extract function" feature

PART 2:

1.  Good practices for targets
    1.  names

    2.  how many?
2.  Parallelization with `tar_make_clustermq()` or `tar_make_future()`
3.  Branching demo
    1.  Just dynamic branching, I think?
        Basically just make them aware that it exists and is powerful for speeding up repetitive tasks
4.  When to use `targets` for a project?
    1.  Consider complexity, time to re-run

    2.  As you get more comfortable with `targets`, you may find yourself using it for even simple projects.

    3.  Collaborating with `targets`

        1.  `_targets` not tracked with git/GitHub

        2.  Cloud storage a possibility, but extra setup

        3.  Save intermediate results with `tar_file()`

I also want to make a template repo that has a cool readme with the mermaid.js graph and instructions for reproducibility that people can start with.
